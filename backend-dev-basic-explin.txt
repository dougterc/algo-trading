Basic webpage for auto trader:
	- Basic webpage (can be local for now)
	- Basic SQL database script
	- Connect webpage to SQL in local folder
	- Webpage should have 5 inputs:
		1 - 'How many number of stocks would you like to buy?'
		2 - 'How much money would you like to put in?' [only accept positive values greater than 200]
			- See if the minimum can be dynamically set. this may be a policy and can be subject to change
					- Thinking a variable set from a super minimal SQL database table of 'factors' or 'rules'
		
		*Industries fall within Sectors*
		3 - 'What sector would you like to invest in?' [string/varchar255]
			- DROPDOWN: list of sectors sent seperate 
		4 - 'What industry would you like to invest in?' [string/varchar255]
			- DROPDOWN: list of industries sent seperate
			- Only industries within the selected sector should be available choices
			- NOTE: There should always be an option for 'Any' which will look at every stock in the sector

		5- 'What is your risk profile?' [numerical. 1, 2, or 3 into SQL. use switch to assign number]
			DROPWDOWN OPTIONS:
				- conservative (1) | high hedging. only around 50% of money put in will go into picked stocks. rest into hedging stocks		
				- moderate (2) | moderate hedging. include some hedge stocks in the portolio, but weight the picked stocks heavier. roughly 70-30. this should be subject to change in a database eventually (my issue to worry about)
				- aggressive (3) | little to no hedging. 90-10 or 100-0 weight for picked stocks vs hedging. just roll with the picked stocks
